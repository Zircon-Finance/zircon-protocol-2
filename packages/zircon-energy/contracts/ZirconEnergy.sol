  /*

  Zircon Energy is the protocol-wide accumulator of revenue.
  It keeps a "bank account" balance for each Pylon and splits it into pure revenue + insurance portion balance

  Ok but how do you split them? You only know balances and delta balances. Especially difficult with double pylons.
  We modify mintFee to trigger calls on ZirconEnergy (need an interface for this)
  TODO: mintFee kinda needs to be modified to know which Pylon called it. Yeah it needs to be modified, only way
  We handle donations by dumping them into the insurance pool, spread evenly between pylons.

  The insurance portion gets used by breakPiggybank, called by Pylons, to finance withdrawals, which is done by sending
  Uni pool tokens to the Pylon (which then redeems them + handles partial/none repayment cases

  How do we handle Float/Anchor tokens? TODO: Change all pylon fees to send the underlying
  They are kept in their unwrapped form to form a cushion. When necessary they are minted (preferably both-sides) into Uni PTs

  EDIT: No, we convert them to UniV2 PTs. Mostly for simplicity â€” can add a risk/asset management system later.


  The insurance portion is managed through a per-Pylon insurance weighting that can be changed by an address stored for it,
  defaulting to governance but tweakable to potentially introduce per-pool governance

  returnExcess does some calculations to check max liability for Anchor (?) and returns any excess accrued to Pylon
  TODO: More study of this

  extractToken then allows governance to withdraw protocol revenue (only).
  It should use some time lock checks (can't withdraw more than X per day)
  and some amount checks (can't withdraw more than X [or percentage of total] in each transaction)

  Also some way to make sure it can't called during a flash loan?
  Hard to make it generalized while letting smart contracts call it.

  All checks can be set by governance. Important to ensure that this doesn't brick the funds somehow.


  addInsurance function can be called by governance to increase a pool's insurance share, which can be used to bail out pools by gov
